    <h3>Etymology</h3>
                    <P>The present-day region of Rayalaseema in Andhra Pradesh was officially referred to as the 'Ceded Districts' ('Datta Maṇḍalālu' in Telugu) under the British Madras Presidency, since the districts had been ceded by the Nizam of Hyderabad to the British.

                      The local intellectuals found the name 'Datta Maṇḍalālu' to be insulting. In 1928, a strong dislike was expressed from the leaders in the Andhra Mahasabha, held at Nandyal and they sought to rename it.
                      
                      The region got its name as Rayalaseema with a proposal from Chilukuri Narayana Rao and was accepted.3The name Rayalaseema hearkened back to the Vijayanagara times, whose Kings used a suffix Rāya (tadbhava of Sanskrit Rājan) or Rāyalu in Telugu as their title.
                      
                      Thus, Rāyalasīma means 'the region or extent of Rāyalu rule'. 'Rāyalu' could also refer to Kr̥ṣṇarāya in particular.</P>
  
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      During the British era, the Nizam of Hyderabad ceded this area to the British, and hence was called Ceded Districts. Independence, it was renamed as Rayalaseema as 'seema' was an administrative territorial entity of the Vijayanagara Empire similar to today's districts.

Post independence
Main articles: Andhra State and Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014
The four districts of the region were part of the Madras Presidency until 1953.[6] From 1953–1956, the region was a part of Andhra State and in 1956, the Telangana region was merged with Andhra State to form Andhra Pradesh State.[7] On 2 February 1970, three taluks from Kurnool i.e., Markapur, Cumbum and Giddalur were merged along with some other taluks of Nellore district and Guntur district to form Prakasam district.</p>

In February 2014, the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 bill was passed by the Parliament of India for the formation of Telangana state comprising ten districts. Hyderabad will remain as a joint capital for 10 years for both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.[8] The new state of Telangana came into existence on 2 June 2014 after approval from the President of India.[9] The formation of a new state named Telangana from Andhra Pradesh is not considered an amendment to the Constitution of India per article 3 and 4 of that document
